# Learning OpenGL
> Implementation following [learnopengl.com](learnopengl.com) chapters.
> Disclaimer: the file structure is very awkward bc every subsequent solution is a copy of the last solution I was working on thus build files thus build files accumulate. Hope to clean up after finishing all chapters.
